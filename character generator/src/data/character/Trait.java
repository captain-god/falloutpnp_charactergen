public enum Trait {
    FAST_METABOLISM("Fast Metabolism","Your metabolic rate is twice normal.  This means that you are much less  resistant to radiation and poison, but  your body heals faster. You get a 2  point bonus to Healing Rate, but your  Radiation and Poison Resistance start at  0% (racial modifiers are added later).  Robots cannot choose this trait."),
    BRUISER("Bruiser","A little slower, but a little bigger.  You may not hit as often, but they will  feel it when you do! Your total action  points are lowered, but your Strength is  increased. You get a 2 point bonus to  Strength, but loose 2 Action Points."),
    SMALL_FRAME("Small Frame","You are not quite as big as everyone  else, but that never slowed you down.  You can't carry as much, but you are  more agile. You get a 1 point bonus to  Agility, but your Carry Weight is only  15 lbs X Strength."),
    ONE_HANDER("One-Hander","One of your hands is very dominant. You  excel with single-handed weapons, but  two-handed weapons cause a problem. You  have a 40% penalty to hit with twohanded weapons, but get a 20% bonus to  hit with weapons that only require one  hand. Animals cannot choose this trait."),
    FINESSE("Finesse","Your attacks show a lot of finesse. You  don't do as much damage, but you cause  more critical hits. All of your attacks  lose 30% of their damage (after  reductions are made for Damage  Resistance, etc.) but you gain a 10%  bonus to Critical Chance."),
    KAMIKAZE("Kamikaze","By not paying attention to any threats,  you can act a lot faster in a turn.  This lowers your Armor Class to just  what you are wearing, but you sequence  much faster in a combat turn. You have  no natural Armor Class (Armor Class is  12  therefore 0 regardless of Agility). You  must wear armor to get an Armor Class.  Your sequence gets a 5 point bonus."),
    HEAVY_HANDED("Heavy Handed","You swing harder, not better. Your  attacks are very brutal, but lack  finesse. You rarely cause a good  critical hit, but you always do more  melee damage. You get a 4 point bonus  to Melee Damage, but your critical hits  do 30% less damage, and are 30% less  likely to cripple a limb or cause  unconsciousness. "),
    FAST_SHOT("Fast Shot","You don't have time for a targeted  attack, because you attack faster than  normal people. It costs you one less  action point to use a weapon. You  cannot perform targeted shots, but all  weapons take one less action point to  use. Note that the Fast Shot trait has  no effect on HtH or Melee attacks.  Animals cannot choose this trait."),
    BLOODY_MESS("Bloody Mess","By some strange twist of fate, people  around you die violently. You always  see the worst way a person can die.  This does not mean you kill them any  faster or slower, but when they do die,  it will be dramatic. Just how dramatic  is up to the Gamemaster."),
    JINXED("Jinxed","The good thing is that everyone around  you has more critical  failures in combat. The bad  thing is: so do you! If you,  a member of your party, or a  non-player character have a  failure in combat, there is a  greater likelihood the  failure will be upgraded  (downgraded?) to a critical  failure. Critical failures  are bad: weapons explode, you may hit  the wrong target, you could lose part of  your turn, or any number of bad things.  Failures are 50% more likely to become  critical failures around the character  or anyone else in combat."),
    GOOD_NATURED("Good Natured","You studied less-combative skills as you  were growing up. Your combat skills  start at a lower level, but First Aid,  Doctor, Speech, and Barter are  substantially improved. Those skills  get a 20% bonus. You get a 10% penalty  to starting combat skills (Small Guns,  Big Guns, Energy Weapons, Unarmed, and  Melee Weapons). This is a one-time bonus. Animals and robots cannot choose this trait."),
    CHEM_RELIANT("Chem Reliant","You are more easily addicted to chems.  Your chance to be addicted is twice  normal, but you recover in half the time  from their ill effects. Robots cannot  choose this trait."),
    CHEM_RESISTANT("Chem Resistant","Chems only effect you half as long as  normal, but your chance to be addicted  is only 50% the normal amount. Robots  cannot choose this trait."),
    NIGHT_PERSON("Night Person","As a night-time person, you are more  awake when the sun goes down. Your  Intelligence and Perception are improved  at night but are dulled during the day.  You get a 1 point penalty to these  Statistics from 0601 to 1800, and a 1  point bonus to these Stats from 1801 to  0600. Robots cannot choose this trait.  Note that the bonus cannot take IN and  PE above the character’s racial maximum  or below the character’s racial minimum."),
    SKILLED("Skilled","Since you spend more time improving your  skills than a normal person, you gain  more skill points. The tradeoff is that  you do not gain as many extra abilities.  You will gain a perk at one level higher  than normal. For example, if you  normally gained a perk every 4 levels,  you would now gain a perk every 5  levels. You will get an additional 5  skill points per new experience level,  and a one-time bonus of +10% to your  skills when you begin the game. Animals  and robots cannot choose this trait."),
    GIFTED("Gifted","You have more innate abilities than  most, so you have not spent as much time  honing your skills. Your statistics are  better than the average person, but your  skills are lacking. All Stats get a 1-  point bonus, but all skills get a 10%  penalty and you receive 5 less Skill  Points per level. Robots cannot choose  this trait."),
    SEX_APPEAL("Sex Appeal","This trait increases your chances of  having a good reaction with members of  the opposite sex. Unfortunately, this  trait tends to annoy members of your  13  sex. Jealous twits. When interacting  with members of the opposite sex, you  gain a 1 point bonus to Charisma for  reactions only. When making Speech and  Barter rolls, you gain a 40% bonus for  each. When interacting with members of  the same sex, you have a 1 point penalty  to Charisma for reactions only and have  a 40% penalty to both Speech and Barter  rolls. Only humans can choose this  trait. "),
    GLOWING_ONE("Glowing One","Extreme radiation exposure has left you  glowing in the dark. Your glow  eliminates modifiers from light in  combat for both you and your enemies.  In addition, you gain a +50% bonus to  Radiation Resistance, but everyone  around you takes 10 rads per hour (see  Radiation under Damage and Death,  below). Only Ghouls can choose this  trait."),
    TECH_WIZARD("Tech Wizard","You spent your formative years hunched  over a bench learning all about the way  things work. The trouble is that you’ve  ruined your eyes! You get a +15% bonus  to Science, Repair, and Lockpick skills,  but you lose 1 Perception. Deathclaws  and Dogs cannot choose this trait."),
    FEAR_THE_REAPER("Fear the Reaper", "You have cheated death! You gain perks  as if you were a human, but you are now  on death’s short list. This means that  once a month, you must roll against Luck  or else drop dead. Only Ghouls can  choose this trait."),
    VAT_SKIN("Vat Skin", "Other people find you hideous to behold  and disgusting to smell after your “dip”  in the FEV vats. The good news is that  you gain a +10 bonus to your Armor Class  thanks to your extra-tough skin. The  bad news is that everyone within ten  hexes of your location, friend and foe,  suffers a 1-point penalty to Perception  (you are unaffected). Only Mutants can  choose this trait."),
    HAM_FISTED("Ham Fisted","Genetic engineering – or dumb luck – has  endowed you with huge hands. You get a  “free” tag skill in Unarmed, but you  suffer a -20% penalty to Small Guns,  First Aid, Doctor, Repair, Science, and  Lockpick Skills (these numbers cannot go  below 0%). Only Mutants can choose this  trait."),
    DOMESTICATED("Domesticated","You have undergone extensive house  training and have developed an aboveaverage Intelligence. Your IN is raised  by 1, and can even go above your racial  maximum, but you get a –2 penalty to  Melee Damage. Only Deathclaws and Dogs  can choose this trait."),
    RABID("Rabid","You are a half-crazed, feral killing  machine. You are not affected by  crippled limbs (blindness still affects  you normally), and every time you kill  an opponent in combat, you get 5 more  APs that round. Chems, including  stimpaks, have no effect on you. Only  Deathclaws and Dogs can choose this  trait."),
    TIGHT_NUTS("Tight Nuts", "This robot was built to take the knocks.  You get double the base Damage  Resistance to any attack, but you gain  only half the Hit Points back from  repairs. Only Robots can choose this  trait."),
    TARGETING_COMPUTER("Targeting Computer","You have been programmed with an onboard  targeting computer. All attacks cost 1  extra AP to perform, but you can always  add +15% to your chance to-hit. Only  Robots can choose this trait."),
    EMP_SHIELDING("EMP Shielding","You have a dedicated EMP shielding  system. It takes you 2 AP to move 1 hex  because of your heavy equipment, but you  have a 30% Resistance to all forms of  EMP attack. Only Robots can choose this  trait."),
    BETA_SOFTWARE("Beta Software","You have been equipped with an  experimental operating system and  peripherals. You get 1 extra Tag Skill,  but whenever using ANY tag skill, you  must roll against Luck or suffer an  automatic failure and, in combat, a loss  of all APs for that round. Only Robots  can choose this trait.");
