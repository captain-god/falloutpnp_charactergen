# falloutpnp_charactergen
a simple fallout character generator for the Fallout PnP RPG (V2 while V3 is in development)

Here's this; a fallout PNP Character Generator, so you don't have to spend an hour making a character because you have to keep looking around the book for stuff. It's developed off of the Fallout PnP RPG (Available [here](http://falloutpnp.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page)) by Jason Mical. It's free to get, so I assume it's free to use. No lawsuits, please.
